    <h1>Doctor Strange</h3>

        <h2>Occult Origins</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Vain, egotistic surgeon Stephen Strange lost the use of his hands in a horrific auto accident caused by his
            own recklessness. In turn, he lost his fortune through a series of costly, complicated and experimental
            surgeries and therapies in an attempt to save his livelihood. In the end, destitute and desperate, he sought
            a cure far off the beaten path of modern medicine.
        </p>
        <p>In Nepal, after being saved from muggers by the powerful sorcerer Mordo, Strange met the person who had
            taught Mordo—Earth’s Sorcerer Supreme, the Ancient One, who held many mysteries of the Old World, including
            the potential to heal Strange’s hands. The Ancient One refused to guide Strange through the process until
            he relinquished his selfishness and opened his mind to a higher truth. Having done so, the doctor began to
            learn of the Multiverse and the ancient science of magic, as well as forbidden knowledge the Ancient One was
            not inclined to share.
